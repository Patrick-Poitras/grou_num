# grou-num

(Pronounced "groo", from the Chiac meaning "big")

This package is a highly experimental, unstable big integer library.

I would not recommend using this for anything currently. It may become useful at some point if it benchmarks favorably.

Otherwise, this is intended to use the currently feature-gated 'bigint_helper_methods' to implement homebrew methods for bigint types.

Currently the focus is primarily on the `Grou` type, which is an unsigned integer.

# Immediate priorities:
* Extend the addition overloads.
* Convert to decimal string.
